<H1>The Breakpoint Window</H1>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>The Breakpoint Window lists all the various breakpoints that exist in
the program. It facilitates modifying breakpoints (make them
temporary or normal, disabled or enabled) and removing breakpoints.</P>

<P>Breakpoint Window topics:

<H3><A NAME="menus">Menus</A></H3>
The Breakpoint Window contains two menus, one which deals specifically with
the individual breakpoints selected in the window, and one whose commands
affect all breakpoints.
<BR>

<H4><A NAME="menus_bp">Breakpoint Menu</A></H4>
The Breakpoint Menu operates on the selected breakpoint only. The type and
state of a breakpoint may be changed by selecting the desired type or
state from the menu:
<DL>
    <DT>Normal
        <DD>The selected breakpoint is a normal breakpoint
    <DT>Temporary
        <DD>Indicates that the breakpoint is temporary
    <DT>Enabled
        <DD>The breakpoint is active and will stop the debugger
            when it is hit.
    <DT>Disabled
        <DD>The breakpoint is being ignored. A disabled breakpoint
            will never get hit.
    <DT>Remove
        <DD>Deletes the breakpoint
</DL>
<BR>

<H4><A NAME="menus_global">Global Menu</A></H4>
Items on the Global Menu affect all defined breakpoints. Users may:
<DL>
    <DT>Enable All
        <DD>Enable all breakpoints
    <DT>Disable All
        <DD>Disable all breakpoints
    <DT>Remove All
       <DD>Delete all breakpoints
</DL>
<BR>

<H4><A NAME="display">Breakpoint Display</A></H4>
The Breakpoint Display is a table of breakpoints. The first column of the
table (unlabeled) shows a checkbutton, indicating whether the breakpoint
is enabled (checked) or disabled (unchecked). Disabled breakpoints are
ignored and will not cause the program to stop.

<P>To use the Breakpoint Menu or the Breakpoint Pop-up Menu, first use
the left mouse button to select a breakpoint from the list, then make the
menu selection.</P>

<H3>Modifying Breakpoints</H3>
To <A NAME="display_state">enable</A> a breakpoint, simply click the
checkbutton in the first column of the desired breakpoint so that it is
selected (checked). To disable a breakpoint, "uncheck" the checkbutton.

<P>To change a breakpoint's <A NAME="display_temp">type</A>, select the
desired type from either the Breakpoint Menu or the Breakpoint Pop-up Menu.
</P>

<P>To remove a <A NAME="display_remove">breakpoint</A>, use the left mouse
button to select the breakpoint to remove and use either the Breakpoint Menu
or the Breakpoint Pop-up Menu to select "remove". To re-install a breakpoint,
use the <A HREF="source.html#setting_a_breakpoint">Source Window Display</A>.
</P>
<BR>

<H4><A NAME="display_popup">Breakpoint Pop-up Menu</A></H4>
The Breakpoint Pop-up Menu is accessed by using the mouse cursor to select
a breakpoint from the Breakpoint Display and then clicking the right button
on the mouse. The Pop-up allows expert users quicker access to the functions
of the Breakpoint Menu:
<DL>
    <DT>Normal
        <DD>The selected breakpoint is a normal breakpoint
    <DT>Temporary
        <DD>Indicates that the breakpoint is temporary
    <DT>Enabled
        <DD>The breakpoint is active and will stop the debugger
            when it is hit.
    <DT>Disabled
        <DD>The breakpoint is being ignored. A disabled breakpoint
            will never get hit.
    <DT>Remove
        <DD>Deletes the breakpoint
    <DT>Global, Enable All
        <DD>Enable all breakpoints
    <DT>Global, Disable All
        <DD>Disable all breakpoints
    <DT>Global, Remove All
       <DD>Delete all breakpoints
</DL>
